My name is Landon Harney, and I am a junior computer science major at Marietta College. Three skills I bring to a software development group are that I am an effective worker in a team with strong teamwork skills, I am a hard-worker and pay attention to detail, and I am helpful in providing new ideas and insights to the project. I look forward to working with everybody and learning about new methods of software engineering to enhance my knowledge.
