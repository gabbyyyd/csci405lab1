My name is Tyler Reich I am a senior at Marietta College studying Information Systems. I hope to work with the CIA or FBI doing cybercrime.

Strengths: One of my strengths that I would bring to a software development table would be communication with others, I am able to communicate very 
           well on what needs completed and how we are completing the objective. I would also like to thing that I am very resourceful when it comes
           to finding out how to write a section of code that I may not be familiar with. A final strength that I would like to thing that I have would 
           be being able to debug code to the best of my ability as well as I am very determined when I run into issues. If I make some sort of mistake  
           or the code does not seem to run I will work on it until I figure out how to fix the error.
