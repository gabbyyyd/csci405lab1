Bio: Hello, my name is Ian Carpenter. I am currently a Marietta College student in pursuit to a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. In the future I am hoping to be a project manager for software engineers at a company.

Strengths: I am adaptable, I can adjust to new situation or working with different people quite well without having much trouble.
           I believe I am a good communicater making it easier for me to understand the team I am working with and it makes it easier for the team since they can understand me.
           My third strength is my ablilty to focus. Once I start working on any project it is extremly difficult for someone to distract me from getting it done. I will constantly be wanting to get to the goal before I decide to do someting else.
