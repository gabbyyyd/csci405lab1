My name is Gabby Davison, and I’m a senior Computer Science major at Marietta College. I also have a minor in Cybersecurity and a certificate in Leadership Studies. Three strengths that I would bring to a software development group are timeliness, dedication, and curiosity. I always get things done on time, I don’t give up easily when I’m faced with challenges, and I’m willing to learn new things.
