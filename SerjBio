My name is Serj Wahl, and I am an Information Systems major at Marietta College. Three strengths I bring to a software development group are persistence, collaboration, and communication. I believe these qualities allow me to stay focused on difficult tasks, work effectively with teammates, and ensure that everyone stays aligned on project goals.
